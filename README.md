# f1-angular-quiz
I did this little project to learn more about Angular!

It uses Angular, Angular CLI, Bootstrap, and the [Ergast Developer API](http://ergast.com/mrd/), which is a great API for getting F1 results and statistics.

The website consists of three different quizzes - race winner quiz, pole position quiz, and world champion quiz.

Below are two screenshots of a quiz and a results page.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
